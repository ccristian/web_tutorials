			document.write("The number is " + i);
			document.write("<br />");
		}
	</script>

	<p>Explanation:</p>

	<p>This for loop starts with i=0.</p>

	<p>
		As long as <b>i</b> is less than, or equal to 5, the loop will
		continue to run.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>i</b> will increase by 1 each time the loop runs.
